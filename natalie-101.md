My primary E-Colors are Blue over Green, which means my personality style is that of the Thinking Relater.

I tend to be even-tempered and supportive of those around me. I'm steady-paced and adopt a cautious approach, taking time to collect information before making a decision or taking action. I like harmony and teamwork and tend to do things by the book.
